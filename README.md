SquidGrid
=========

gh-pages branch
---------------

The gh-pages branch contains all the files for the [SquidGrid website](http://gigglesquid.github.io/SquidGrid/ "SquidGrid website")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This branch is currently running SquidGrid **pre-alpha 0.0.5**, an extemely preliminary version of the framework that is **_not_** currently available in the [master branch.](https://github.com/GiggleSquid/SquidGrid "SquidGrid master branch")


**Please be awear** that since this is a very preliminary vesion, there are still obvious uses of [Toast](http://daneden.github.io/Toast/) and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) since this framework is based on both; there are also, probably, many bugs within this version.
